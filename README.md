# Euroleague Shot Profiles

**Live app:** https://baranerdogan11.github.io/Euroleague-Shot-Profiles/

Player stats and animated shot charts for every Euroleague player in the 2026-27 season, updated game by game
from the league's official feeds. Pick a team, pick a player: season numbers, shooting splits, accuracy by zone
of the floor, and every field-goal attempt of the season plotted on a half court, made and missed, played back
in order.

## What it shows

- All 20 clubs with crests; player dropdown limited to the selected club's registered roster
- Media-day photo, number, position, height, age, nationality, games and minutes
- Per-game PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, PIR and fouls drawn
- 2P%, 3P%, FT% and true shooting, with makes over attempts
- Five-zone accuracy: rim, paint, mid-range, corner 3, above-break 3
- Animated shot chart with made / missed filter, single-game filter, and a Zones view shading the floor by FG%
- Hover any shot for the game, quarter, distance, fast break and second chance
- Game log
- 2D and 3D shot charts: the 3D view (Three.js, loaded on demand) replays every attempt as a ball in flight with camera presets and orbit
- Before a club's first game the page shows the roster and the date of the opener; stats and charts fill in as games are played
- Deep links: `#ULK`, `#ULK/P007200`, `#ULK/P007200/zones` (club code, player id, optional zones view)

## Update after each round

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fetch_season.py E2026   # clubs, crests, rosters, photos, then shots and box scores for new games
python build.py E2026          # writes index.html and teams/E2026/*.json
git add -A && git commit -m "Update after round" && git push   # GitHub Pages redeploys in about a minute
```

`fetch_season.py` caches every game, roster and image under `cache/`, so a rerun only downloads what is new.

## Layout

- `index.html`: the page (loads a club's JSON when it is selected)
- `teams/E2026/index.json`, `teams/E2026/<CLUB>.json`: compact per-club data (stats, game log, shots)
- `photos/<player>.webp`, `logos/<CLUB>.png`: media-day photos and crests
- `fetch_season.py`, `build.py`, `template.html`: the pipeline and page source

The page fetches its data files, so serve the folder over HTTP to run it locally
(`python -m http.server 8000`, then open http://localhost:8000/); opening `index.html` directly from disk will not load data.

## Data

Rosters, crests, photos, box scores and shot coordinates come from the Euroleague official API and live feeds.
Coordinates are in centimetres relative to the basket; the court is drawn to FIBA dimensions.
